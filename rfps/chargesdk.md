# Automated Wallet Creation SDK

* **Status:** Open
* **Proposer:** JonaKoester
* **Your Project:** charge.xyz

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Currently, users for any web2 services (such as food delivery services / ride hailing services / EV charging services) create personal accounts with mobile application providers MSPs and go through KYC processes to pay in traditional payment methods such as Apple Pay & Credit Card for the services that they consume.

The SDK that Charge aspires to build would utilise the existing information of the users in the mobile applications and enable the mobile application providers to instantly create a wallet for the users that can act as SSIs for the users.
Furthermore, along with existing payment mechanisms such as Apple Pay, the users will now have an additional payment option called 'pay with charge (in this case)'.

This option will enable users to pay with their credit card but the on/off ramp provider in the background converts the Fiat into cryptocurrency to enable the wallet to wallet transactions.

Through this process, the users will not have to create a separate wallet, which is currently a challenging process for non-crypto natives. Moreover, the mobile applications, which were only web2 will instantly be converted to web3 enabled applications without putting users through any hassle of creating additional wallets and go through gruelling additional KYC processes.
